# face-recognition-template
Template using python and cv2 for live face detection which can also do a task when a face is recognized

Installing opencv-python was a bit of a hassle as it would not install dlib normall on my machine. If you search up how to install opencv-python on google, there are tons of great examples on how to fix common errors.

The main purpose of this repo is to provide a quick and dirty template for beginning live facial recognition of you or someone else, and then allows you to do a task based on the person you see, or if you see someone. This should be a good starting point for anyone looking to do something with live facial recognition.
